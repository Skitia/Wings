'Wings' for Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition

Version 0.91b

There shall be wings! If the accomplishment be not for me, 'tis for some other. The spirit cannot die; and man, who shall know all and shall have wings...
	- Leonardo da Vinci

This mod adds quite a bit of extra content for everyone's favorite wingless wonder, Aerie.

- A few small, minor character encounters, such as a new NPC in the circus tent (after beating Kalah) that Aerie can interact with.

- Aerie now has a chance to acquire her own familiar!

- A friendship path for Aerie. Player Characters not eligible to romance Aerie may still befriend her, with a whole set of talks. PC's who are eligible to romance her, but choose not to, may still be presented with the option to pursue a friendship instead.

- New banters between Aerie and other NPC's. She gets along especially well with Imoen.

- A small cosmetic change to Aerie herself. Beamdog recolored all the NPC's based on their portraits, but in Aerie's case because of the lighting in her portrait they got it wrong. She's referred to as being fair and pale a few times in the games text. So I just changed her skin and hair back to how it was originally. While it wasn't strictly necessary, I also changed the lighting in her portrait to match.

To install:

Simply unrar to your game directory (For me its C:\Program Files (x86)\BeamDog\Games\00783\), and then double click the file ‘setup-Wings.exe’, and follow the instructions.

To uninstall, just double click setup-Wings.exe again.

OPTIONAL:

You'll be asked if you want to restore missing banters. These are banters already present in Aerie's banter file from the game, but never appear in gameplay as they lack a set of trigger conditions. This changes that.
